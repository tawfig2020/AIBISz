  <h1>Why frequent failures including the Eritrean National initiatives???</h1>
    <p>Recent changes and rapid events have confirmed that Eritrean community in diaspora, which practices political and national activities as the opposition or under any other name are not mature to achieve tangible change.  A change that save the nation from failures and overcome the Government negative practices which makes youth to flee the country. Eritreans youth are risking their lives to cross the border, the Sina dessert and the human traffickers to cross the sea and reach Europe.</p>
  <p>Civil society organization still lacks experiences and organized work, such as the strategic visions that organize its work and give it future readings which allows for practical planning and the use of a renewed and multiple methods. There are various shortcoming practices namely are:
	The prevailing nature of the work is dominated by the emotional side, it is being observed that the beginning of any national project or initiative as a result of the reactions in a way of advocacy or shedding light on them in order to be promoted through social networks to gain public momentum.
	It may be the result of advocating a social case or a mass movement, in either case, the motivation is one, which is the momentary emotional enthusiasm that begins to accelerate and its burning desire soon extinguished as a result of the absence of success factors to the continuation of the enthusiasm.
	Sometimes the national activity experienced an incomplete initiative which lacks sufficient time for study and preparation or even the circumstances surrounding it. As well as investigating the factors of success or failure, the challenges and the risks that might face the initiative activity.</p>
  <p>What is lacking the rational work, or rather systematic plan? 
Which come after deep reflection and extensive studies in which the factors and conditions are identified, and the priorities of action are determined. In most countries, this type of practice is known as strategic planning in which diligence research is being applied and carried out through research centres. It is being practiced even in investment and commercial companies, it is known as the Research and Development (R&D) which determines the type of products and services that meet consumer needs and expectations to generate more revenues. Even the superpowers that control our wealth and our fateful decision use research and strategic studies to keep their business and protect their interests.</p>
